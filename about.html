		<h2>About:</h2>
		<p>
			Alloy consists of two lightweight core components. Firstly Alloy will take 
			care of 2D &amp; 3D graphics, audio, and controller input. The other 
			component of Alloy is an element system.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Alloy, a game created with <code class="go">core.Init()</code> will 
			become a top	level element. Elements have the ability to create component 
			elements of themselves with <code class="go">Element.add()</code>. 
			Elements can be	anything from a 3D position, to a game scene, or anything 
			else you can code as a Go package.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cool part about all of this though, is that elements can be configured
			with artist-readable text files, and a development goal is an IDE that can
			read and write these configurations, test game scenes, and still work well
			alongside non-IDE users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alloy has a long ways to go, though. And the engine needs your help. The
			project is free <i>(as in freedom)</i>, and can be forked on 
			<a href="https://github.com/alloyengine">github</a>. Pull requests are 
			welcome!
